# Octopus iOS Demo

## AccessKey

Octopus requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Octopus SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Setup

Replace `{YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE}` inside [`ViewModel.swift`](OctopusDemo/OctopusDemo/ViewModel.swift) with your AccessKey obtained from [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/).

## Usage

Open the OctopusDemo Xcode project and build. Launch the demo on a simulator or a physical iOS device.
