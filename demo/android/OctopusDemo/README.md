# Octopus Demo

This Android demo runs Octopus in the foreground (i.e., when the app is in focus).

## Setup

1. Replace `String appID = "..."` inside [`MainActivity.java`](/demo/android/OctopusDemo/octopus-demo-app/src/main/java/ai/picovoice/octopusdemo/MainActivity.java) with your AppID generated by [Picovoice Console](https://picovoice.ai/console/).
```java
private static final String appID = "YOUR_APPID_HERE";
```

## Usage

Launch the demo on your phone using Android Studio.

1. Press the record button.
2. Start talking. Record some phrases or whatever audio you would like to search.
3. Press stop. Wait for the info box to display "Indexing Complete". This may take a few seconds.
4. Enter your search phrase into the text input and press search. The results will appear below.
5. You can continue to enter in new search phrases without re-recording or re-indexing the aduio.
